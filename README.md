# dublin-footfall-index
A repository for the cleaned dataset from:
https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/pedestrian-footfall-index-in-dublin-city-centre

The data is stored in a grid with no dates for the recorded number of pedestrians.

The notebook XXX details what had to be done.

I also created a resource file with estimated latitude and longitudes for the entrances. This is saved in the folder resources/
